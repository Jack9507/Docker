Docker Networks:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/

Network Types AKA Drivers:

Driver	    Description
bridge	    The default network driver.
host	    Remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host.
none	    Completely isolate a container from the host and other containers.
overlay	    Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together.
ipvlan	    IPvlan networks provide full control over both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
macvlan	    Assign a MAC address to a container.


Default bridge networks are used from communication between the containers in same network.
If we have two containers "cont1" & "cont2" with ip addr. "172.17.0.2" & "172.17.0.3" respectively,
then cont1 can reach the ip address of cont2. 

NOTE: there is no automatic DNS resolution in default bridge network.
but if you create a custom brigde network then containers in that networks will have automatic DNS resolution.
